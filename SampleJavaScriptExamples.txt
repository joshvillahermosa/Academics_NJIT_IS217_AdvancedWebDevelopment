5 JavaScript Examples: (All found from Github, cloned, and tested on my local machine)

1.Calendar Picker - Kalendae - https://github.com/ChiperSoft/Kalendae
The reason why I chose this particular calendar picker because it has a wide range on how to pick dates. This can be useful for creating a site for planning events.

2.Gallery Viewer - GalleryViewer - https://github.com/jackwanders/GalleryView.git
This particular gallery viewer is great because it includes the title of the picture and shows a preview on the bottom.

3.Graphs - Flotr2 - https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/Flotr2.git
Drawing graphs are useful when collecting data and converting it to useful information.

4.Form Validator - jQuery-Validation-Engine - https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine.git
Used to help validate forms and data so that any following script will not fail.

5.Mario - mariohtml5 - https://github.com/robertkleffner/mariohtml5.git
Awesome mario game. Going to attempt to recreate if I have enough time (Not good enough to understand how it works ... yet).

The best I can recreate is the Gallery Viewer (2). I do not have a good understanding with JavaScript, but I am familiar create a slide show using JavaScript. Hopefully some parts will still apply.
